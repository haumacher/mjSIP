/** LocationService is the interface used by a SIP registrar to access to a
  * location repository.
  * <p> A LocationService allows the maintinance of bindings between users and contacts.
  * <br> For each user the LocationService should maintain information regarding:
  * <br> - username, that is a fully qualified name for this service (e.g. alice@example.net)
  * <br> - data, that is an opaque block of data (a string),
  *        that can be set and fetched for any service-depending use,
  * <br> - contacts/expires, that is the list of user contacts with the time when it expires,
  * <p> LocationService has a set of methods for query and modifing such data.
  * <p> Some of these methods include an optional parameter <i>app</i> that could be used 
  * to implement application-dependent mobility, i.e. lists of contacts that are specific
  * for particular applications. This feature might be used by guessing the application
  * by the SIP body (e.g. SDP) or by a new non-standard Application header (ref. [draft-XX.txt])
