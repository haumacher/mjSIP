/** Wallclock time (absolute date and time) represented using the
  * timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
  * <br>
  * It is the absolute time in seconds relative to 0h UTC on January 1, 1900.
  * The full resolution NTP timestamp is a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point number with
  * the integer part in the first 32 bits and the fractional part in the
  * last 32 bits.  In some fields where a more compact representation is
  * appropriate, only the middle 32 bits are used; that is, the low 16
  * bits of the integer part and the high 16 bits of the fractional part.
  * The high 16 bits of the integer part must be determined
  * independently.
  * <p>
  * Since only 32 bits are used for the integer part, February 7, 2036, at 6h:28m:15s
  * is the last absolute time returned by the method getTime(), while at 6h:28m:16s
  * it wraps and go back to January 1, 1900.
  * <br>
  * In order to have a longer absolute period, the time returned by method getTime() is
  * within the interval from January 20, 1968, at 4h:14m:8s  GMT,
  * until February 26, 2014, at 9h:42m:23s GMT.
  * <p>
  * However, for RTP purposes, only differences between pairs of NTP
  * timestamps are used.  So long as the pairs of timestamps can be
  * assumed to be within 68 years of each other, using modular arithmetic
  * for subtractions and comparisons makes the wraparound irrelevant.
  * <p>
  * The Network Time Protocol and the timestamp format are defined in RFC 1305
  * (Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation and Analysis), and
  * RFC 2030 (Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI).
